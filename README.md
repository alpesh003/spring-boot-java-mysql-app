Simple Spring Component Based App to demonstrate component based spring security with different roles.

This is a sample lightweight project only. Will be integrating with MYSQL DB for maintaining users in DB.

# Implementations available so far:
- Spring security implementation using component based bean injections.
- User roles controls of the APIs
- Simple factory pattern using @Qualifier annotation.
- Factory pattern implementation using a factory class.

# Next steps:
- To connect with MySQL DB over JPA
